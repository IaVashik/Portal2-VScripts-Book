<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Chapter 2.2: Entity Scripts and <code>self</code></h2>
<p>The real power of VScript comes from attaching scripts <em>directly to other entities</em>. Almost any entity in Hammer (a <code>prop_dynamic</code>, a <code>func_button</code>) can have a script attached to it via its <code>vscripts</code> keyvalue.</p>
<p>If you have ten turrets, you can give each one the same script, and each will run its own independent version of that script.</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4"><code>self</code>: The Most Important Variable</h3>
<p>When a script is attached to an entity, VScript gives it a special variable named <code>self</code>.</p>
<p><code>self</code> is a <strong>script handle</strong>. It's your script's connection to the entity it's attached to. It's how you tell the turret to fire, or the door to open.</p>
