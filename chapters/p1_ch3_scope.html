<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Chapter 1.3: Scope and The Root Table</h2>
<p>Where your variables and functions "live" is called their <strong>scope</strong>.</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
    <li>Variables created with <code>local</code> only exist inside the curly braces <code>{ }</code> where they are defined. This is a <strong>local scope</strong>.</li>
    <li>Variables created in a table exist within that table's scope.</li>
    <li>Variables not inside any function or table live in the <strong>global scope</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Squirrel, the global scope is just one giant table called the <strong>root table</strong>. When you write <code>myVar <- "hello"</code> at the top level of your file, you are creating a slot in the root table.</p>
<p>You can explicitly access the root table from anywhere using the <code>::</code> operator.</p>
<pre><code class="language-squirrel">// This creates a slot 'globalMessage' in the root table.
globalMessage <- "This is a global message."

function SomeFunction()
{
// This creates a variable that only exists inside this function.
local localMessage = "This is a local message."

// To access the global variable from inside a function, we must use ::
printl(::globalMessage)
}

SomeFunction()
// printl(localMessage) // This would cause an error! localMessage doesn't exist here.
</code></pre>
<p class="p-4 bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-900 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 rounded-r-lg"><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Always use <code>local</code> for temporary variables inside functions. Only use global variables (<code>::</code>) when you absolutely need data to be accessible from everywhere. Overusing them can lead to messy, hard-to-debug code.</p>
