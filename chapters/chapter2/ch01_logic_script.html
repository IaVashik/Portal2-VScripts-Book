<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Chapter 2.1: The <code>logic_script</code> Entity</h2>
<p>The simplest way to run a script file is with a <code>logic_script</code> entity. This is a special entity you place in your map that has no physical presence; its only job is to run code.</p>
<p>When the map loads, the engine will find your <code>logic_script</code> and automatically run the code inside its specified script file (from top to bottom, one time). This makes it perfect for setting up map-wide logic, preparing puzzles, or starting timers when the level begins.</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">A Pre-made List of Contacts: The <code>EntityGroup</code></h3>
<p>A very powerful feature of the <code>logic_script</code> is its ability to be pre-loaded with handles to other entities. Think of it like giving your script a phonebook of important contacts it might need to call.</p>
<p>In Hammer, you'll see keyvalues named `EntityGroup00`, `EntityGroup01`, and so on. By filling these with the targetnames of other entities in your map, you make them instantly available to your script inside a special <strong>Array</strong> called `EntityGroup`.</p>

<h4 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Example: Opening a set of doors at map start.</h4>
<p><strong>In Hammer:</strong></p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Create a <code>logic_script</code>.</li>
    <li>Set its "VScript File" property to <code>door_manager.nut</code>.</li>
    <li>Set its "EntityGroup00" property to <code>exit_door_01</code>.</li>
    <li>Set its "EntityGroup01" property to <code>exit_door_02</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In <code>door_manager.nut</code>:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-squirrel">// This script runs as soon as the logic_script spawns.
printl("Door Manager Script is now running!")

// The 'EntityGroup' array was automatically created for us
// because we filled it out in Hammer.
// EntityGroup[0] now holds a handle to "exit_door_01".
// EntityGroup[1] now holds a handle to "exit_door_02".

// We can loop through this pre-made list to control all the doors.
foreach(index, doorEnt in EntityGroup) {
    printl("Opening door #" + index)
    EntFireByHandle(doorEnt, "Open", "", 0, null, null)
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is much more efficient than writing separate <code>Entities.FindByName()</code> calls for every single door.</p>
