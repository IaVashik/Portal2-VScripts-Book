<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Chapter 5.1: Intro to PCapture-Lib</h2>
<p>Congratulations! You have mastered the fundamentals of VScript. You can manipulate entities, manage logic, and even bend the engine to your will with creative hacks. You've reached the limits of what Portal 2's standard scripting tools can offer.</p>
<p>Now, it's time to break those limits.</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Why You Need a Library</h3>
<p>Think of the standard VScript API as a basic toolbox. It has a hammer, a screwdriver, and a wrench. You can build a lot, but some tasks are incredibly difficult:</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
    <li>Your "laser beam" (<code>TraceLine</code>) is blind to players and cubes.</li>
    <li>Creating timed sequences is a mess of manual delay calculations.</li>
    <li>Making an object move smoothly from A to B requires complex math in a Think function.</li>
    <li>Inter-script communication often relies on cluttering the global scope.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PCapture-Lib</strong> is a professional-grade power tool kit. It's a massive, community-built library that gives you new, powerful, and intuitive functions to solve these problems and many more. It is the "super-tool" that nearly all modern, complex Portal 2 maps use.</p>
<p class="p-4 bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-900 border-l-4 border-blue-500 rounded-r-lg">
    While its size might seem intimidating, PCapture-Lib is designed to be user-friendly, stable, and predictable. Its functions have clear names and behave exactly as you'd expect, making your code cleaner and more powerful.
</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Installation</h3>
<p>Using the library is incredibly simple. It's just another script you include in your project.</p>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Download:</strong> Get the latest <code>PCapture-Lib.nut</code> file <a href="https://github.com/LaVashikk/PCapture-LIB/">from the official repository.</a></li>
    <li><strong>Place:</strong> Put the file in your <code>portal 2/portal2/scripts/vscripts/</code> folder alongside your other map scripts.</li>
    <li><strong>Include:</strong> At the very top of your main <code>logic_script</code> file, add this single line:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-squirrel">// This must be the first line of your script to make all library functions available.
DoIncludeScript("PCapture-Lib.nut", getroottable())
</code></pre>
<p>That's it. You are now ready to use the most powerful VScript toolset ever created for Portal 2.</p>
