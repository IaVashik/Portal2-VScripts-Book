<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Welcome to The VScript Book</h1>
<p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-6">This book is your comprehensive guide to creating custom gameplay in Portal 2 using VScript. We will start from the absolute beginning—assuming you have no prior programming experience—and build your skills step-by-step. Our goal is to empower you to turn your creative puzzle ideas into interactive reality.</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Who Is This Book For?</h3>
<p>This guide is written with a primary focus on <strong>Portal 2</strong> and its specific version of VScript (which uses the <strong>Squirrel</strong> language). Every example and project is tailored for the world of Aperture Science.</p>
<p>However, the fundamental principles of the Squirrel programming language and the VScript system are universal across many Source Engine games (like Team Fortress 2 and CS:GO). While some game-specific functions may differ, the logic and structure you'll learn here provide a rock-solid foundation for any Squirrel-based VScript project, making this book a valuable starting point for any aspiring Source Engine scripter.</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">About the Author</h3>
<p>This guide was written by <strong>laVashik</strong>, a VScript developer well-known in the Portal 2 modding community for his technical mastery of the engine. His experience is forged from years of pushing Portal 2 to its absolute limits, culminating in the creation of <strong>Project Capture</strong>—one of the most technically ambitious mods for the game, powered by over 10,000 lines of VScript code.</p>
<p>Much of that work led to the development of <strong>PCapture-Lib</strong>, the powerful VScript library that you will master in the later parts of this book. This library encapsulates advanced techniques, engine workarounds, and performance optimizations to provide functionality that is both incredibly powerful and easy to use.</p>
