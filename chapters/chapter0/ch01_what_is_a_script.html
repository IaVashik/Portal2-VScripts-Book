<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Chapter 0.1: What is a Script?</h2>
<p>At its heart, a video game is a simulation running on a set of rules. A Companion Cube falls due to the rule of gravity. A button, when pressed, sends a signal because of a rule. A door opens when it receives that signal.</p>
<p>A <strong>script</strong> is a file containing a list of instructions that you, the creator, write for the game to follow. It's your way of adding new rules to the simulation.</p>
<p>VScript is the system within Portal 2 that reads your instruction files. The language we use to write these instructions is called <strong>Squirrel</strong>. Learning to script is like learning a new language to communicate your ideas directly to the game engine.</p>
