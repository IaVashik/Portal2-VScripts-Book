<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Congratulations!</h1>
<p>You have completed the core curriculum of The VScript Book. You have journeyed from the fundamental concepts of programming to the advanced, Portal-bending capabilities of the PCapture-Lib.</p>
<p>The world of Aperture Science is now your sandbox. The rules are yours to write.</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What's Next?</h3>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Explore:</strong> Dig into the full PCapture-Lib documentation. Every module has a <code>readme.md</code> file filled with examples for every single function.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment:</strong> Start a new test map. Give an entity a script and just try things. Use the <code>script</code> console command to test ideas in real-time. See what works. See what breaks.</li>
    <li><strong>Build:</strong> Think of a simple puzzle mechanic and try to build it. Start small and build upon your successes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mt-6">Good luck, test subject. We are watching.</p>
