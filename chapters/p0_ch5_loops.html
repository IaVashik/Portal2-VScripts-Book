<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Chapter 0.5: Repeating Actions with Loops</h2>
<p>Sometimes you need to repeat an action multiple times. Imagine you want to spawn 5 explosive barrels. You could write:</p>
<pre><code class="language-squirrel">SpawnBarrel()
SpawnBarrel()
SpawnBarrel()
SpawnBarrel()
SpawnBarrel()</code></pre>
<p>This is repetitive and inefficient. What if you needed to spawn 100? This is where <strong>loops</strong> are essential.</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The <code>for</code> Loop</h3>
<p>A <code>for</code> loop is perfect when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat an action. It has three parts in its parentheses, separated by semicolons:</p>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
    <li><strong>Initializer:</strong> A temporary counter variable is created (<code>local i = 0</code>). This runs once at the very beginning.</li>
    <li><strong>Condition:</strong> The loop continues as long as this question is <code>true</code> (<code>i < 5</code>). It's checked before each repetition.</li>
    <li><strong>Incrementer:</strong> An action to perform after each repetition (<code>i++</code>, which is shorthand for <code>i = i + 1</code>).</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-squirrel">// This loop will run 5 times.
for (local i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
// The code inside these curly braces is the "loop body".
printl("Spawning barrel number " + i)
}
printl("All barrels spawned.")</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">Spawning barrel number 0
Spawning barrel number 1
Spawning barrel number 2
Spawning barrel number 3
Spawning barrel number 4
All barrels spawned.</code></pre>
<p>Notice the counter <code>i</code> starts at 0 and goes up to 4. When <code>i</code> becomes 5, the condition <code>5 < 5</code> is <code>false</code>, and the loop stops.</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The <code>while</code> Loop</h3>
<p>A <code>while</code> loop is used when you don't know how many repetitions you need. It repeats as long as a condition remains <code>true</code>. This is great for actions that depend on player behavior or game state.</p>
<pre><code class="language-squirrel">local playerIsInPoisonGoo = true
local playerHealth = 100

// This loop will continue as long as the player is in the goo.
while (playerIsInPoisonGoo == true)
{
playerHealth -= 5 // Damage the player
printl("Player health is now: " + playerHealth)

// In a real game, another piece of code would set playerIsInPoisonGoo to false.
// For this example, let's just stop it manually after some damage.
if (playerHealth <= 70)
{
    playerIsInPoisonGoo = false
}
}
printl("Player has escaped the goo!")</code></pre>
<p class="p-4 bg-red-100 dark:bg-red-900 border-l-4 border-red-500 rounded-r-lg"><strong>Beware of infinite loops!</strong> If the condition in a <code>while</code> loop <em>never</em> becomes false, the script will get stuck repeating forever, crashing your game.</p>
